          <div className="story-text">
            <p>
              In the heart of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in the year 2010, a dream was born. 
              Alem Tesfaye, a third-generation perfumer, opened the doors to a small boutique 
              that would change the world's perception of African perfumery forever.
            </p>
            <p>
              The name "Abeni" holds deep meaning in Amharic - "we asked for her, and behold, she came." 
              This name was chosen to symbolize the belief that each fragrance finds its perfect wearer 
              through a special connection, much like how the right person finds their way into our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a single store with just three fragrances has grown into an international 
              luxury brand, but our commitment to authenticity and cultural preservation has never wavered.

            <div className="process-step-detailed">
              <h3>1. Ingredient Discovery</h3>
              <p>
                Our journey begins in the diverse ecosystems of Ethiopia - from the misty highlands 
                where wild roses bloom, to the Rift Valley where sacred incense trees grow. We work 
                directly with local farmers and foragers who have been harvesting these botanicals 
                for generations.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="process-step-detailed">
              <h3>2. Traditional Extraction</h3>
              <p>
                Using methods passed down through our family, we extract the purest essences from 
                our ingredients. This includes steam distillation, cold pressing, and traditional 
                enfleurage techniques that preserve the authentic character of Ethiopian botanicals.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="process-step-detailed">
              <h3>3. Creative Blending</h3>
              <p>
                Our master perfumers, led by Alem herself, carefully blend these essences to create 
                harmonious fragrances. Each blend tells a story - whether it's the morning mist over 
                Lake Tana, the spice markets of Harar, or the coffee ceremonies of the highlands.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="process-step-detailed">
              <h3>4. Quality Assurance</h3>
              <p>
                Every fragrance undergoes rigorous testing to ensure longevity, stability, and 
                skin compatibility. We maintain the highest standards while staying true to our 
                traditional methods and natural ingredients.
